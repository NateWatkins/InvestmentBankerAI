Simple File Archiver for InvBankAI
===================================

This is a beginner-friendly file archiving system that:
1. Copies important data files to dated archive folders
2. Keeps track of what gets archived
3. Uses simple Python that anyone can understand
4. Won't break your main functions if something goes wrong

Usage:
    from simple_archiver import archive_file
    archive_file("data/features/AAPL_features.csv")
