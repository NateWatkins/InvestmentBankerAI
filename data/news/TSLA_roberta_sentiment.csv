For Tesla, the launch of between 10 and 20 Model Y vehicles follows a decade of unfulfilled promises of self-driving vehicles from CEO Elon Musk, who last year staked the company’s future on such technology as it pivoted away from chasing rapid growth in electric-vehicle sales.  The Austin robotaxi launch, which Musk says will ""tentatively"" open to the public on June 22, comes as Tesla tries to arrest a global vehicle-sales slide, stemming from both its aging lineup of human-driven electric vehicles and Musk's right-wing political activities."
